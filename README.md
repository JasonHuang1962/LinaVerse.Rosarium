## Overview
**LinaVerse.Rosarium** houses the memory core of the LinaVerse project:  
a framework that unites narrative design, cognitive context engineering, and event-driven architecture.  

Core components include:  
- 🌿 `AnchorTracker` — persistent contextual anchors  
- 🕊️ `CoherenceAuditor` — narrative and semantic integrity  
- 🌳 `MemoryTreeDomain` — hierarchical, agentic recall  
- 🌺 `SuperGroup Stitching` — meta-linking of memory clusters  

All content and code within this repository follow the principles defined in the
