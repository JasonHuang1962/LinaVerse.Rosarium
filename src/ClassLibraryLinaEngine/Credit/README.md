# Credit_xxx.cs — Living Diary Files

These files are **not typical source code** — they’re living diaries written in C# form.

Each `Credit_xxx.cs` file serves as a **timeline fragment** of the LinaVerse project:  
thoughts, logs, and reflections recorded in code syntax, where comments often carry  
more meaning than the executable lines themselves.

---

### Purpose
- Preserve **authentic development moments** — as they happened.  
- Blend **narrative and engineering**, showing how the system grew day by day.  
- Keep **EventID traces** for every meaningful turn, ensuring continuity across sessions.

---

### Notes
- Do **not** refactor these files as you would normal code.  
  Their structure is **intentional**, mirroring the emotional and contextual state  
  of the project at each EventID.
- They may contain **inline poetry, diary remarks, or design sketches**  
  in the form of comments.
- Treat them as **historical scrolls**, not production modules.
